<p>Excel is widely known for its spreadsheets, often used for accounting purposes. However, it is a very practical program to use in the classroom as well. Consider simplifying your organizational documents such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Class Checklists</li>
        <li>Seating Charts</li>
        <li>Accommodation Tracker</li>
        <li>Communication Logs</li>
        <li>Test Data</li>
    </ul>
<p>**Note that many organizations offer free downloads of Microsoft Office. Check with your workplace or educational institution.**</p>

<header>Creating and Saving Spreadsheets</header>
<p>When you open Excel, you have the option of either opening a 'Blank Workbook,' viewing tutorials, or accessing 'More templates.' It is possible available templates, such as budget or calendar templates, will meet your needs so peruse them as you wish. When you select More templates, a search bar will appear. Below that bar are suggested searches which are commonly used templates.</p>
<p>To save your spreadsheet, select the save icon at teh top of the document. You should give your spreadsheet a unique name that indicates the contents: 1st Period Seating Chart is better than Book1. You can save the spreadsheet as different file types. Most often you will leave it as the default (.xlsx or .xls) or save as a pdf. Make sure you save your spreadsheet in a location in which you will easily find it.</p>

<header>Autofill</header>
<p>Most online gradebooks give you options to export class lists to an Excel document. The lists are not always numbered though and teachers certainly  want to keep an eye on their class count. You can easily insert a column at the start of your document by following the steps below.</p>
<code>Hover over A- you may see a down arrow. Right click and select Insert.</code>
<p>Once you have your blank column, you can start filling in numbers. Numbering each line of your 30+ roster is tedious though so you have an <strong>autofill</strong> option. You can start typing the first three numbers then:</p>
<code><p>Option 1: Select all three cells then drag the bottom corner (you'll see a dark green square on the corner) as far down as you need to complete your series.It is very important to select all three cells in this example. If you do not, it may fill all 1s or not work at all. </p>
<p> Option 2: Select all three cells, got to "Fill" in the "Editing" section of the home screen. Select "Series..." If you are filling down the column, as I describe, make sure your series selector is on Columns. This is a linear series. Step value means what you want to count by: here we are going up by 1 each time. For the Stop value, put in whatever your final count number is. If you have a class of 32, write 32.  </p></code>
<p>Autofill is also good for days of the week, months, or any other patterns you often use.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="sort">
<header>Sort</header>
<p>Let's say you are looking at a spreadsheet full of test result data- maybe from a state test. You will have difficulty interpreting the data without customizing it to your needs. I typically sort my test data from least to greatest. You can do this with or without column headings, but it makes sense to write in a simple descriptive heading, such as "Test 1." Select the heading cell, go to the Editing section on the home screen and select Sort & Filter. From there, you can choose how you want to sort. The Sort & Filter section has two other important features.</p>
<code>
    <p>
    Custom Sort: There are three columns here. The first row you see is how you're already sorted or a common sort if you have not yet done one. You can then Add Level and sort within your first sort by another characteristic. For example, I might want to first sort my students by class period and then by test score. Or I may want to sort by test score and then by Special Education indicator.    
    </p>
    <p>
     Filter: When you select Filter, a drop down arrow appears on the column. When you click it, you will see all the unique items in that column. This could be class periods, or subjects, or teachers. When an administrator gives us school-wide data, I immediately filter to only see data attached to my name.   
    </p>
